# Amazing Store

Amazing Store simulates the behavior of an online shopping webpage with two possible profiles: as a client or as the manager of the store.
By now there's no restricted methods depending if you are logged in or not as a client, but you have to log in as the manager to have access to the complete list of the products in the store and to be able to manage it by adding and removing products, which are stored in a real database. To log in as the manager use both username and password: 'manager', and to log in as a client use both username and password: 'client'.

### Project URL: https://amazing-store-dcf57.web.app/

## Project behavior:
There are two sections for the client user: Home and Cart.\
In Home you can search for products to buy. Actually you can search for them in any page but the complete list of results only appears in the Homepage. The complete list of products are stored in a real database and they are not a lot, so I invite you to first log in as the manager take a look at the Products List and then try to search for some of then as a client.\
In the cart you can add more quantity to a product you already added to the cart, or you can completely remove one.

For the manager there are also two sections: Add Products and Products List.\
In the Add Products section, the manager can add a new product with a new category or in a already created category. Try creating a new product and give it a look on the Products List. By the way, please be prudent when creating a new product, remember that they are stored in a real database and everyone visiting this project will be able watch them.\
In the Products List, the manager can check all the products and their id references, and delete products from the database. Here you are provided a searchbox which uses the category, the name of the product and the reference id to match your quest.

# Amazing Store

This is a React project I am currently working in. 

Amazing Store simulates the behavior of an online shopping webpage with two possible profiles: as a client or as the manager of the store.
By now there's no restricted methods depending if you are logged in or not, except for the manager, which have access to the complete list of the products in the store and they can manage it by adding and removing products. To log in as the manager use both username and password: 'manager', and to log in as a client use both username and password: 'client'.

### Project URL: https://amazing-store-dcf57.web.app/

## Project behavior:
There are two sections for the client user: Home and Cart.
In Home you can search for products to buy. Actually you can search for them in any page but the complete list of results only appears in the Homepage.
In the cart you can add more quantity to a product you already added to the cart, or you can completely remove one.

For the manager there are also two sections: Add Products and Products List.
In the Add Products section, the manager can add a new product with a new category or in a already created category. Try creating a new product and give it a look at the Products List.
In the Products List, the manager can check all the products and their id references, and delete products from the database.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
